# Cheqd

### Intro

The [cheqd Network](https://explorer.cheqd.io/) is a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain that facilitates the exchange of trusted, verifiable data off-chain [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), using on-chain identifiers (Decentralised Identifiers '[DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)'). The cheqd Network leverages the [cheqd DID](https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method) method and enables [linked resources](https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/guides/did-linked-resources) to be written to the network, associated with a DID and controlled using the verification methods in the DID Document. Through this approach, the cheqd Network is able to natively support all major credential types: VC-JWT, JSON-LD and AnonCreds across an array of enterprise SDKs. cheqd also has a dedicated token, $CHEQ, used for identity writes to the network, voting in a decentralised governance framework as well as for various payment flows between verifiers, holders and issuers of Verifiable Credentials.



### Getting Started

* [Create DID](create-did.md) - Create your first `did:cheqd`
* [Issue VC](issue-vc.md) - Issue your first Verifiable Credential based on a did:cheqd
* [Verify VC](verify-vc.md) - Verify your Credential based on a did:cheqd
