# Keys

Cryptographic keys convey control over digital identities and enable core functionality such as encryption and authentication.

The SSI Kit supports:

* EdDSA / ed25519
* ECDSA / secp256k1
* RSA

_Note that we are continuously adding support for new key types._

You can learn more about keys [here](../../what-is-ssi/technologies-and-concepts.md).
