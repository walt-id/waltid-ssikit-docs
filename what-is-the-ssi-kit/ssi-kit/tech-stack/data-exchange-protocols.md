# Data Exchange Protocols

Authentication and data exchange protocols (e.g. OIDC/SIOP) enable the exchange of data (VCs) between different parties.

The SSI Kit supports latest OpenID Connect extension for SSI:

* [OpenID Connect for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1\_0.html)
* [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1\_0.html)

The implementation of the protocols is conformant with the latest specs from EBSI [https://api-conformance.ebsi.eu/docs/wallet-conformance](https://api-conformance.ebsi.eu/docs/wallet-conformance)

You can learn more about protocols [here](../../../ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/technologies-and-concepts/).
