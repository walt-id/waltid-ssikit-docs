# Credential Templates

They are the blueprint on which Verifiable Credentials are issued, and we offer two variants:&#x20;

1. [Prebuild templates](../getting-started/rest-apis/signatory-api.md#list-templates) for the most relevant use-cases
2. [Custom Templates](../getting-started/rest-apis/signatory-api.md#import-template) to help you issue use-case specific verifiable credentials when the prebuild ones are not enough. You can also watch our [intro video](https://youtu.be/RjM0RyUQDR0) to custom templates.
