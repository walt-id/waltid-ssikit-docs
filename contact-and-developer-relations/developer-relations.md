# Product & Dev Roadmap

Our product development process is public so that everyone can see what we are building. This way, we want to make it as easy as possible to

* [influence our roadmap](influence-the-roadmap.md)
* [contribute to our open source projects](contribute.md)

You can find everything you need to know about our product and development plans in our _Roadmap_ and on our _Dev Board:_

## The "Roadmap"

The _Roadmap_ gives you a functional overview of our product plans and key releases. You can see:

* what we are working on (products, features),
* timelines (expected release dates),
* our motivation (why we are working on this issue).

The _Roadmap_ in a nutshell:

| **Purpose**         | Communicate goals and product plans publicly so that potentially anyone can influence and contribute. |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Target Audience** | Anyone (developers, managers, business analysts, researchers).                                        |
| **Perspective**     | High-level and functional (incl. key releases and benefits).                                          |
| **Timeframe**       | Shows plans for the next 3 months.                                                                    |
| **Update Cycle**    | Weekly (minor changes) and/or monthly (significant changes).                                          |

## The "Dev Board"

The _Dev Board_ gives you a detailed and technical perspective on our product plans by listing concrete issues and tasks on which developers are working.

The _Dev Board_ in a nutshell:

| **Purpose**         | Coordinate the daily work of developers (technical implementations). |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Timeframe**       | Shows plans for the next 2-3 months.                                 |
